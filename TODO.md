# TO-DO LIST

## Gameplay
- ⏳ Quest overhaul (being worked on by nebby and tomtomtom)
- Field guide
	- Fix other field guide pages that are referring to missing recipes (they're listed in the log)
- Add insulation for GT armors and diving suits, increase durability of existing clothes
- Make our favourite ores hazardous again :)
- Early game create changes
	- change blast furnace to require coke, make anthracite turn into multiple coke, also make anthracite better? it's pretty bad rn
- Generate bismuth item pipes similar to tin, bis bronze fluid pipes similar to bronze

## Mods
- Aleki roofs needs to be hidden, it only shows vanilla woods - can't remove it because the ships depends on it
- Recipes for advanced peripherals and computercraft
	- half of computercraft seems to have vanished for some reason?
- ✔ Add recipes for chalk (nebby finished this)
- Add the one with trans-dimensional logistics? See how difficult it is to make a second "cannon" so we can have one reskin for the nether and one reskin for space
- ✔ Move over the create deco and locometal recipes from 0.7.19 PRs, update the lights to use glowstone dust? (done by redeix)
- Add builders wands

## Technical
- GT + TFC food expiration compat
- Finish porting everything else in tfg-core that can be ported
- Fix up the ores field guide generator tool
- Add that create movable blacklist tag to greg crates, see if it stops people being able to put them on contraptions
- Add deepslate blobs to the bottom of the overworld to make people suspicious?

## Beneath
- Try out the python script to redo bastions? Would be a lot easier than doing them all manually again
	- Retexture the vanilla lantern, add loot table for it
- Add entity zoning supervisor and see if it lets us put tfc animals in the nether
- ⏳ A cold water drinkable fluid (for your flask) that lowers your internal temp? Will need java code (being worked on by jojo)
- Make an "abandoned camp" structure? Put skeleton photo and spyglass in its loot table?

## Post-0.9
- Create 6

## Space
- Put carve tags onto your rock types so they get carved correctly
- Make a custom chunk extension for planets so we can use tfc's climate-dependent features
	- https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.20.x/worldgen/decorators/#climate
- Tag prefix to auto generate bricks?
- Reskin the rockets to match the GT casing textures
- Caelum TFC mod? makes the sky look more interesting which is thematic, is it compatible with ad astra?
- Waypoints but retextured, is there a way to make it require "payment" like through a bucket of rocket fuel?
- Configure forgiving world to work with orbits

### Mars
- Merge the cold + temperate biomes on mars and instead spread out the different forest tiers
- Come up with like 3 kinds of "trees" to replace vanilla ones, like dark oak + acacia = type 1, spruce + birch = type 2, etc
- Is it possible to have volcano features without the tfc:volcano_caldera? How does it work?
- Apparently mars regolith has a lot of perchlorate
- SHAI'HULUD
