# Post-0.9
- Create 6
	- Check create 6 compatibility
		- Vintage improvements: no, but there's a fork which is
		- Framed blocks: yes
		- Greate: yes
	- Change greate's config to allow assemblers to make cables again
- Use mech press whenever Greate updates to let us do our own recipes for it
- Buff duration of the 5-day foods like sandwiches
- Add recipe for the infinite water cover
- Packer recipes to turn cobble into loose rocks

## Ideas for whenever
- ❓ Give "Aged Corn Whiskey" and "Aged Rye Whisky" status effects when drank
- ❓ Add that mod that disables xp
- ❓ Overworld/upper nether structure with skeleton photo and spyglass in its loot table?
- ❓ GT + TFC food expiration compat
- ❓ Drinking cold water from your flask lowers your internal temp? Will need java code, gt comes with a 'liquid ice' fluid we could use

## Space
- Put carve tags onto your rock types so they get carved correctly
- Make a custom chunk extension for planets so we can use tfc's climate-dependent features
	- https://terrafirmacraft.github.io/Documentation/1.20.x/worldgen/decorators/#climate
- Tag prefix to auto generate bricks?
- Reskin the rockets to match the GT casing textures
- Caelum TFC mod? makes the sky look more interesting which is thematic, is it compatible with ad astra?
- Waypoints but retextured, is there a way to make it require "payment" like through a bucket of rocket fuel?
- Configure forgiving world to work with orbits
- Add the mod with trans-dimensional logistics?

### Mars
- Merge the cold + temperate biomes on mars and instead spread out the different forest tiers
- Come up with like 3 kinds of "trees" to replace vanilla ones, like dark oak + acacia = type 1, spruce + birch = type 2, etc
- Is it possible to have volcano features without the tfc:volcano_caldera? How does it work?
- Apparently mars regolith has a lot of perchlorate
- SHAI'HULUD
