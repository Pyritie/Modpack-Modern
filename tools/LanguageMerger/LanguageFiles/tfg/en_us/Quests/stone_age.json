The time it takes to heat things in the forge is considerably faster than the Pit Kiln, and is much easier to control too.\n\nTo make the forge you'll require at least 7 charcoal, and 5 rock-like blocks, such as raw rock or cobblestone.\nThe Forge does not use Logs, instead it uses Charcoal, Coal or Coke.\n\nCheck the field guide for walkthroughs on how to make a Charcoal Pit and a Charcoal Forge.",

To start with though, we'll turn those raw ores you mined into Crushed Ore by putting it through the Quern. Just this first step is enough to increase the amount of mB your ore will melt into.",
