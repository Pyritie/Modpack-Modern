There are several types of ore veins, such as: cluster, sphere, pipe and a few rare others that we will not talk about. \n3. To make life easier for players, ore indicators appear on the surface, under which in most cases the ore vein itself is located. \nTFG contains a small Wiki for this in an Excel spreadsheet.
